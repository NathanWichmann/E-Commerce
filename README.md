# 13 Object-Relational Mapping: E-Commerce Homework Assignment
This repository (E-Commerce) is an educational homework assignment from the CARL-OTT-FSF-PT-02-20121-U-C course. It was designed to help students become more familiar with
MySQL tool called Sequelize. Working on the framework of MySQL queries, Sequelize uses a language of your choice, in this case JavaScript, to make queries and send json data to a database and API calls to a website. Wikipedia defines ORM: "in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language.
The task was to take existing code and add model code, Sequelize and configure the API routes to make the required queries.

## User Story

```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies.
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```

# What I learned 
The thing is I do see how much easier Sequelize is compared to MySQL. The queries were extremely difficult in MySQL and I was not able to get one. I really do enjoy the back end much more, there seems to be more to do, and it is fun to make the connections with the server and the APIâ€™s. I enjoy making the front end as well, however the back end seems easier for me for some reason. I will be going back to review the front end with a lesson book on html and CSS, maybe it will come easier now that everything is not all brand new to me.
